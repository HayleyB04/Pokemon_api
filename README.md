# Pokemon_api

I created a console app that uses the Pokeapi. The user can play a game where they have to find heavy Pokemon. They input the Pokemon id number and are shown information about the Pokemon. If the Pokemon is heavy they have won the game, if it is not they are given the chance to try another Pokemon.

This involved the following skills:

- If and else statements were used to check if the weight of the Pokemon met certain requirements
- The name and weight of each Pokemon were stored in a dictionary
- A while loop allows the user to try again when choosing a Pokemon
- The rules function was created to remind the user of the rules throughout
- Slicing the day of the week into a shortened format
- Using inbuilt functions such as input() to allow the user to write their name, and str() to return a string object when showing the weight of a Pokemon
- Using an API to get some information as json
